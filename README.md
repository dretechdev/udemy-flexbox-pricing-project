# udemy-flexbox-pricing-project
This is a pricing table project which features three pricing categories which shows customers which features they get based on their choice of subscription.
The goal of this project is to create a responsive pricing table for all media breakpoints without using media queries. Also, when the contents gets to a certain breakpoint, the pricing plans would stack on eachother vertically.
